"""Eval quality gate.

Codifies structural defect classes that can corrupt an evaluation result, so
they cannot silently recur in any plugin.

FAILS on unambiguous bugs:
  1. Referenced fixture missing on disk. The scenario fails at setup, which
     reads as a skill failure.
  2. Referenced fixture cannot be materialized by git. `.gitignore` once
     silently swallowed a Cobertura fixture, and git does not preserve empty
     directories or untracked content behind a tracked symlink.
  3. Cobertura `line-rate` contradicts its own `<lines>`. The crap-score skill
     documents both parse paths, so the two arms can read different inputs and
     the eval measures that disagreement instead of the skill.
  4. Whole-file Cobertura totals contradict the declared file rate, for lines
     (`lines-covered`/`lines-valid` vs `line-rate`) or branches
     (`branches-covered`/`branches-valid` vs `branch-rate`). Summary attributes
     are another parse path, so mismatched totals split readers on the same
     fixture.
  5. Aggregate `line-rate` contradicts the `<lines>` beneath it. File, package,
     and class rates are often the prompt-level coverage number, so disagreement
     there changes what the scenario is asking about.
  6. Grader with a missing or empty required config. The YAML parses, but the
     grader silently enforces nothing and the scenario has one fewer assertion
     than it appears to.
  7. A dormancy guard with any nonempty `reject_skills`, or a normal direct-skill
     stimulus with wildcard rejection. The former can make the skilled arm
     identical to baseline; the latter prevents treatment from using the target.
  8. Fewer than MIN_STIMULI preference-eligible distinct stimuli. Explicit
     dormancy scenarios are activation-contract evidence, not preference votes.
     The pass gate applies an exact one-sided sign test and cannot reach 5% on
     fewer than five discordant votes
     (0.5^4 = 0.0625 > 0.05 >= 0.031 = 0.5^5). Repeated runs measure the
     reliability of one task; they do not create independent task samples.
     Existing evals are grandfathered through a shrink-only allowlist.
  9. Duplicate key in a mapping. YAML keeps the last one, so a stray second
     `prompt:`/`environment:`/`graders:` block silently overwrites the scenario
     it lands in, turning it into a clone of another. Scenario counts still look
     right, which is why only the parser can catch it.
 10. A spec declaring the deprecated top-level `config:` alias. Vally 0.14
     reports it as deprecated, and its loader throws when a spec later adds
     `defaults:` beside it. Require the current `defaults:` spelling so the
     repository has one settings schema.
 11. Duplicate stimulus names. Vally pairs comparison trajectories by stimulus
     name and trial index, so names are slot identity, not display text.
 12. Stimulus-level `timeout`. Vally only reads the suite-level
     `defaults.timeout`; a timeout on one stimulus is silently ignored.
 13. Unquoted code tokens beginning with `#` in a rubric item. YAML treats the
     token as a comment and silently truncates the assertion.
 14. Golden trajectory or patch missing on disk. Vally cannot load the oracle.
 15. Golden trajectory or patch not tracked by git. A local run can pass while
     CI receives an eval that points at a file absent from the checkout.
 16. Golden patch does not apply to the stimulus inputs. A stale patch is a
     broken reference even when both the fixture and patch exist.
 17. Golden patch paired with an output grader but no golden trajectory. The
     patch supplies workspace state, not the reference response that the output
     grader must inspect.
 18. Capability stimulus without capability, risk, and journey tags. Results
     cannot be sliced into an actionable failure category.
 19. Golden trajectory whose final response fails a deterministic output
     grader. A reference that its own eval rejects is not a GREEN oracle.
 20. `dotnet test` run-command grader that checks only the process exit code.
     `dotnet test` can exit 0 when discovery fails and zero tests run, so the
     grader must also assert test-run output.
 21. Golden trajectory that is not valid ATIF. Vally accepts only system, user,
     and agent steps; tool calls and observations belong on an agent step.
 22. Golden trajectory that claims completed edits, builds, tests, installs,
     or commands without evidence the oracle replays. Workspace claims require
     a golden patch; execution claims require a run-command grader. Tool events
     are not proof because Vally permits hand-authored observations.

Every failing check above is deterministic. Content checks use only exact
rubric copies and explicit completed-action verbs, not an LLM judgement.

REPORTS warnings for explicit oracle debt and judgement calls: capability
stimuli without a reference, expected workspace changes without replayable
state, simple response references hidden in separate JSON, grandfathered
underpowered evals, orphaned fixtures, targets with no eval, and dormancy guards
that appear to lack an anti-hijack rubric item. Warnings do not fail unless
`--strict` is passed.
