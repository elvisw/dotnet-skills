Executor sessions append the exact scenario workspace to the system context.
Do not resolve fixture paths against a staged skill's base directory or the
shared evaluator root. Normal shell pre-tool hooks defer to the SDK's typed
shell permission request: forcing an `ask` decision there creates a separate
custom permission request without shell-path metadata and causes an
`Unsupported permission request during evaluation` denial. Explicit
`deny_shell` and offline-workflow policies still reject the tool before
execution, including nested sessions; normal path, network, and link checks
remain in the permission callback.

PowerShell permission requests may omit `possiblePaths` even for an explicit
project argument. The executor recovers paths only for a single static
`dotnet build`, `test`, or `run` invocation with known options, then applies the
same workspace allowlist. Compound commands, computed paths, arbitrary MSBuild
properties, response-file tokens, home-expanded path operands, unknown options,
and outside projects remain rejected. VSTest substring filters may still use
`~`; it is rejected in path operands, not globally. Submit
validation commands separately rather than combining them with shell control
flow.

Reference-only skill catalogs remain excluded from model invocation. Executor
context lists their actual staged file paths so consumers can read bundled
language guidance without a failing skill-tool call. The workspace and typed
permission contract version participates in baseline identity; recompute
baselines recorded before this contract rather than comparing old denial
behavior against the corrected executor.

This guide is intended primarily for AI agents investigating skill evaluation failures, though humans will find it useful too. It documents the `results.json` schema, common failure patterns, and recommended fixes.

## Workflow-package evaluation

Individual gh-aw package manifests are accepted by `skill-validator evaluate`.
Their raw results use `skillKind: workflow`; CI adaptation sets
`evaluationLane: workflow-prompt-sdk`. The baseline has no workflow instructions
or package resources. The isolated arm loads the real workflow and imported
Markdown bodies with installed resources; the package arm additionally registers
the bundled agents. The synthetic primary persona is `workflow.<package>` so it
does not collide with a bundled agent with the package's name.

This lane measures offline decisions and proposed outputs, **not** live Actions
bootstrap jobs, collector execution, authentication, or GitHub publication.
Keep compiled-package and trusted-helper checks separate from prompt-quality
results. Do not interpret an agent's publication claim as execution evidence.
Shell execution is denied by runtime permission and pre-tool hooks in every
baseline, isolated, package, and nested model session. File tools remain
available for evidence inspection and proposal creation; only `result.json` is
writable in an offline model workspace. Permission hooks and filesystem-provider
callbacks prevent writes, appends, renames, removals, and new directories from
altering evidence or installed package resources, including resources outside
`.github/`. Evaluator-owned session-state I/O, setup,
and deterministic grader commands are separate from model tool permissions.
SDK pre-tool events may omit argument paths; the filesystem provider still
validates every resolved mutation rather than treating missing metadata as a
write authorization.
Workflow scenarios record an internal offline-policy marker in baseline criteria
so cached baselines from a shell-enabled policy are not reused. This is separate
from an explicit `deny_shell` stimulus constraint, which deliberately requires a
denial attempt to prove that its negative path was exercised. Ordinary offline
scenarios need not request a forbidden tool to complete successfully.
The proposal-only write scope also participates in baseline identity so
shell-denied but resource-writable baselines cannot be reused.

A missing import/resource or an unresolved prompt expression is a setup failure.
Provide expression values as strings in the fixture `workflow-context.json`,
keyed by the exact trimmed expression, for example
`{"github.event.pull_request.base.sha":"0123456789abcdef"}`. Never substitute
empty defaults for missing context. A justified workflow noop is an active
decision scenario, not an `expect_activation: false` routing scenario.

All required arms, structured-output graders, pairwise evidence, expected-result
accounting, and existing completion/activation gates still apply. Saved session
hashes include the manifest and every installed resource, not just the main
workflow. Rejudge retains workflow identity. Runtime gh-aw `graders:` metrics
remain in the actual workflow run's artifacts and are not these A/B verdicts.

Each raw run retains the proposed `result.json` text as
`metrics.workflowProposalJson` and appends it to `metrics.agentOutput` before
judging. This prevents a short "done" response from hiding the actual proposal
from comparison or later investigation. Missing or malformed proposals are
completion evidence for deterministic graders, not successful defaults. Linked
files and proposals larger than 1 MiB fail evidence capture explicitly.

Shared `tests/agentic-workflows/` root contracts and grader changes require
evaluation and select every workflow package; package-local edits remain scoped
to their owning package. Both same-repository and fork PR status gates recognize
shared inputs. Fixture integrity uses POSIX relative-path ordering and LF-normalized
content so Windows and Linux authenticate the same inputs; a digest mismatch is
not a model-quality failure and must not be bypassed.

The dashboard data generator preserves workflow kind and execution-lane metadata,
uses exact workflow-persona activation in both benchmark and value aggregates,
and links to the evaluated package manifest and eval spec. Missing persona
activation stays unknown rather than borrowing sibling-skill activity.

## Using this guide with an AI agent

This document is designed to be read by AI coding agents. When a skill evaluation has failures, the PR comment includes a ready-to-use prompt — just copy and paste it to your AI agent. The agent will download the artifacts, read this guide, analyze the results, and suggest fixes.

If you need to run the investigation manually, follow the [Quick start](#quick-start) below.

## Quick start

1. **Download the results artifact:** `gh run download <run-id> --repo dotnet/skills --pattern "skill-validator-results-*" --dir <path>`
2. **Read `summary.md` first** for a quick overview of which scenarios passed/failed
3. **Read `results.json`** for the full metrics, agent output, assertions, and judge reasoning
4. **Identify the failure pattern** using the categories below — most failures match multiple patterns; fix them in priority order (timeouts first, then activation, then quality/rubric issues)
5. **Apply the fix** and re-run with `/evaluate`

## Finding the artifacts

### Via CLI (recommended for AI agents)

Extract the workflow run ID from the **Full results** link in the PR eval comment (e.g., `https://github.com/dotnet/skills/actions/runs/23520818616` → `23520818616`), then:

```bash
gh run download <run-id> --repo dotnet/skills --pattern "skill-validator-results-*" --dir ./eval-results
```

This downloads all result artifacts into subdirectories, each containing `results.json` and `summary.md`.

> **Note:** The `--pattern` flag is important — without it, `gh` will attempt to download all workflow artifacts including non-zip files (e.g., `.tar.gz`), which causes an extraction error and a non-zero exit code even though the eval results download successfully.

### Via browser

From the PR comment, click the **Full results** link to open the GitHub Actions workflow run. Then:

1. Click on any job (e.g., `evaluate (technology-selection)`)
2. Expand the **Upload results** step
3. Find the `Artifact download URL` in the log output
4. Download and extract

Alternatively, scroll to the bottom of the workflow run summary page and download from the **Artifacts** section.

## Understanding `results.json`

Each file contains a top-level object with:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `schemaOwner` | `skill-validator`. This distinguishes the retired evaluator output from Vally adapter results |
| `schemaVersion` | Legacy skill-validator results schema version. The first explicit version is `1`; older unversioned files remain readable |
| `model` | Model used for agent runs |
| `judgeModel` | Model used for judging |
| `timestamp` | When the results were written (UTC) |
| `verdicts[]` | Array of per-skill results |

### Verdict structure

Each verdict contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `schemaOwner` / `schemaVersion` | The same legacy schema identity, repeated so standalone `verdict.json` files are self-describing |
| `skillKind` | `skill`, `agent`, or `workflow`; workflow packages use the offline native prompt lane |
| `skillName` | Compatibility field containing the skill or custom-agent name |
| `passed` | Overall pass/fail |
| `scenarios[]` | Array of per-scenario comparisons |
| `overfittingResult` | Overfitting analysis (if enabled) |

### Scenario structure

Each scenario includes two required runs (baseline + isolated). It may also include an optional plugin run, and their comparison:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `scenarioName` | Human-readable scenario name |
| `baseline` | Run without the skill |
| `skilledIsolated` | Run with only this skill loaded |
| `skilledPlugin` | Optional run with the full plugin loaded (may be null when plugin runs are disabled) |
| `timedOut` | Whether any run hit the timeout |
| `isolatedImprovementScore` | Weighted improvement (isolated vs baseline) |
| `pluginImprovementScore` | Weighted improvement (plugin vs baseline); optional and only computed when a plugin run is present |
| `isolatedBreakdown` | Per-metric contribution to the score (see below) |
| `pluginBreakdown` | Per-metric contribution to the score (see below); optional and only populated when a plugin run is present |
| `pairwiseResult` | Judge's rubric-by-rubric comparison |
| `perRunScores` | Per-run improvement scores used by the statistical gate. Agent evaluations always use isolated-vs-baseline scores because the plugin arm is diagnostic. Skill evaluations use `min(isolated, plugin)` when a plugin run is present and the isolated score otherwise |

> **Note:** Scenarios do not have a `passed` field. To determine pass/fail for an individual scenario, check whether `improvementScore >= 0`. For skills, this effective score is the minimum of isolated and plugin scores when both arms exist. For agents, it is always the isolated score; `pluginImprovementScore` and `pluginBreakdown` remain diagnostic production-surface telemetry. The `passed` field exists only at the verdict level.

> **Agent activation:** Expected-active native custom-agent scenarios select the
> target agent as the primary persona in both isolated and plugin arms. After
> `SelectAsync` succeeds, the evaluator records `agent.primary_selected`; this
> direct event is authoritative activation evidence even when the SDK omits
> `SubagentSelectedEvent`. SDK subagent events remain delegation and
> organic-routing telemetry and are deduplicated with the direct event by agent
> name. Expected-dormant scenarios register the target agent but do not preselect
> it, so neither the direct event nor forced activation is present and both arms
> exercise normal routing. Dormant scenarios are excluded from
> preference scoring, and unexpected target selection in the isolated arm fails
> the activation contract. Missing target activation in an expected-active
> isolated arm is also a verdict gate, while plugin-arm activation remains
> diagnostic.

> **Skill activation:** Expected-active scenarios require target activation in
> both isolated and plugin arms. Expected-dormant scenarios must keep the target
> inactive in the isolated arm; unexpected isolated activation fails with
> `unexpected_activation`, while plugin-arm activity remains diagnostic. Inline
> and cross-directory rejudge reapply the same contract from persisted
> `expect_activation` metadata. Databases created before schema version 4 retain
> this field as unknown when migrated. Rejudge then recovers the expectation from
> the current target's matching `eval.yaml` scenario when possible, using the
> stored checkout path or the current repository and requiring persisted prompt
> text to still match when available. If the eval, scenario, or matching prompt is
> unavailable, it uses the legacy expected-active behavior instead of inventing
> historical dormancy.
> Schema-version-4 databases keep their explicit values while migration removes
> the old non-null/default constraint so schema 5 has one consistent shape.

> **Plugin skill staging:** Plugin runs load staged copies of manifest-declared
> skills rather than exposing the source directories directly. Skill directories
> and `SKILL.md` files must remain inside the plugin without symlink/reparse-point
> components, and linked descendants are omitted while copying the skill tree.
> Runtime file and shell permissions include the staged copies but exclude the
> original plugin source tree, so evaluation changes cannot mutate the checkout.
> The evaluator captures `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` for its SDK client, then
> removes both aliases from the process and every setup-command or command-grader
> child environment.
> The session filesystem provider stores `session-state/*` under the private
> config directory, resolves relative file-tool paths from the scenario
> workspace, limits absolute paths to the private evaluator root, and rejects
> any reparse-point or symbolic-link component that escapes the selected root.
> Evaluator clients use a process-private directory under the system temp
> directory as their SDK filesystem root because the shared client is created
> before per-scenario `sv-*` workspaces. Fixtures and staged skills are created
> beneath that private root, which is created with owner-only permissions on
> Unix and a protected owner-only ACL on Windows. Per-session pre-tool and
> permission hooks further restrict file access
> to the current fixture workspace and its explicitly staged skill/plugin
> directories. Judge, overfitting, and rejudge sessions also receive tracked
> private work directories beneath that root; they never use the shared system
> temp directory as their working or absolute-access root. The filesystem
> provider receives only the current workspace and explicitly staged roots,
> and multi-path file operations validate every source and destination. File
> reads, metadata queries, writes, appends, and directory creation walk from
> an opened allowed root with OS no-follow semantics, so a path component
> replaced after validation cannot redirect the operation through a symbolic
> link or reparse point.
> Permission requests fail closed: read/write paths use the same containment
> checks, URL access is denied, shell requests without path or URL metadata
> are limited to a small exact local-command allowlist, and MCP access is
> limited to registered, sanitized servers and their explicitly declared
> tools; an omitted tool list permits none, while an explicit `*` permits all.
> The native evaluator currently accepts only the repository's shipped
> `dotnet dnx Microsoft.AITools.BinlogMcp --yes --prerelease` stdio launch
> shape as input, then rewrites it to package version 3.0.2 with a
> validator-owned NuGet configuration, trusted source, and private package and
> HTTP caches. Plugin-supplied environment variables, arbitrary runtimes,
> scripts, projects, and package substitutions are rejected before the server
> starts.

> **Command graders:** A Vally `run-command` grader with an explicit `args`
> array executes `command` directly with those argument boundaries preserved.
> When `args` is absent, the command remains a shell string so existing quoting,
> redirection, and compound-command behavior stays compatible.

> **Denied-shell native scenarios:** A stimulus with `deny_shell: true` keeps
> shell tools available but rejects their execution through evaluator-owned
> pre-tool and permission callbacks in every arm, including nested-agent
> callbacks. Run-command aliases such as `execute`, `bash`, and `powershell`
> are shell tools for this policy. The policy is captured from the eval before the session starts,
> not read from an agent-editable workspace file. File reads and edits retain
> the existing path and session-state restrictions; this option never grants
> additional permissions. Setup commands and post-run command graders remain
> evaluator-owned and run normally. Each actual rejection records
> `evaluator.shell_denied` with the requesting `sessionId` in the saved events.
> The automatic `ShellDenied` assertion fails when no rejection was observed,
> even if the output claims denial or a shell tool was merely advertised.
> This is a native-lane extension, not a Vally tool constraint.
> A denied operation is recoverable and does not itself invalidate a completed
> run; the scenario's artifact and output graders decide whether the partial
> task outcome is correct. Omission (or `false`) preserves normal permissions
> and existing baseline identities. Enabling denial changes the baseline key,
> preventing reuse of a normal-permission baseline for a restricted run.
> The trusted validator must include this extension before enabling such
> stimuli in CI: evaluation workflows build it from `github.workflow_sha`,
> not the evaluated PR checkout. Older binaries can ignore the unknown YAML
> option, so results without the `ShellDenied` assertion and trusted rejection
> event are not denied-shell evidence. Do not rebuild the control plane from
> untrusted eval content to work around version skew.

> **Saved deterministic results:** Both inline and `--no-judge` execution save
> assertion results and `taskCompleted` after artifact/constraint evaluation,
> before any judge runs. Rejudge retains those results and restores expected
> denial from saved `ShellDenied` assertions or evaluator-owned denial events.
> It must not reinterpret evaluator artifact validation as agent execution.
> Older recordings with empty assertion results cannot establish artifact
> completion from rejection events alone; rerun them for objective evidence.
> Pre-assertion snapshots remain in the nonterminal `grading` state, so an
> interrupted grader cannot leave raw metrics masquerading as a completed run.
>
> **Native routing checks:** `constraints.reject_agents` rejects actual
> `subagent.started` events for the named delegates, not primary-agent selection.
> Qualified agent names are matched to their canonical names.
> `constraints.reject_shell_retries: true` rejects shell-tool requests after an
> evaluator-recorded capability-wide denial, including parent requests after a
> child's denial. These opt-in constraints enter baseline identity and persist
> as assertion evidence through rejudge. The SDK prompt includes the active
> custom-agent identity; primary evaluation also honors a profile's declared
> exclusion of itself from its delegates. Organic routing remains available
> when the target has not been selected as primary.

> **Reused baselines:** When the run was invoked with `--baseline-from`, the `baseline` arm is not executed — its `metrics` and `judgeResult` come from the shared baseline file produced earlier with `--baseline-out` (computed once, honoring `--runs`). Such scenarios are reported with the `baseline-reused` session phase and a `reused` baseline status. The baseline file is keyed on `--model` and `--judge-model` plus, per scenario, a SHA-256 of the prompt and a composite SHA-256 over its setup inputs (copied test files, explicit setup files, and setup commands) and its evaluation criteria (rubric, assertions, expect/reject tools, and turn/token/timeout limits); reuse fails fast if the agent model, judge model, or any prompt-plus-setup-plus-criteria identity is missing, so the baseline you compare against is always identity-matched and a shared prompt across cases with different fixtures or rubrics cannot cross-contaminate. Because the baseline output is identical across every skill/agent that consumes the same file, this acts as a shared control group and removes baseline run-to-run variance from cross-skill comparisons.

> **Decoupled runs and judging:** `evaluate --no-judge` runs the agent arms and persists `sessions.db` but performs no judging and needs no baseline file, so baseline and treatment arms can run in one parallel pool. Each persisted session row carries a `baseline_key` column — the same prompt-SHA-plus-target-SHA identity used for baseline reuse. Scenario execution failures are persisted with terminal `failed` status and make `--no-judge` return nonzero; recoverable failed tool calls remain ordinary error metrics and do not invalidate a completed run. Rejudge rejects any baseline or treatment database containing failed sessions instead of silently dropping them. A later `rejudge <treatment-dir> --baseline-dir <baseline-dir>` selects baseline roles from the baseline database and isolated/plugin roles from the treatment database, requires exactly one baseline with the same key and run index for every treatment run, and requires every selected treatment role to carry the same key. It then runs the same judges and gates an inline `evaluate` would and writes results back to the owning databases. Cross-directory rejudge also requires complete accounting: any unmatched, duplicate, unknown-role, keyless baseline, or key-mismatched selected run is listed by skill, scenario, run, role, session ID, and baseline key, and stops rejudge before judging or publishing a partial verdict. Complete three-arm recordings are supported in both databases; irrelevant valid arm roles are ignored after role selection. Inline rejudge enforces the same baseline-key agreement and rejects duplicate baseline, isolated, or plugin role records for the same skill, scenario, and run. Every run for one scenario must agree on its persisted activation expectation; mixed eval revisions fail closed. Inline and cross-directory rejudge reject any database with a nonterminal session before judging, including an interrupted `running` plugin arm beside completed baseline and isolated arms. Inline rejudge similarly stops when a completed run group lacks its required baseline or isolated arm. Inline rejudge accepts normal and reused baselines plus both skill and agent isolated/plugin roles. It persists each new scenario's activation expectation, reconstructs target activation from saved events, and reapplies the skill or agent activation-contract gate. When an older database has no expectation, rejudge first reads the current matching eval scenario and otherwise preserves the legacy expected-active behavior. Baseline and treatment must share `--model`; the judge model resolves to `--judge-model`, else the treatment DB's persisted judge model, else the baseline DB's, and a mismatch between the two persisted judge models (without an explicit override) is rejected.

### Breakdown fields

The `isolatedBreakdown` and `pluginBreakdown` objects show how each metric contributed to the improvement score. Each field is a raw delta (not yet weighted). The final score is computed as a weighted sum:

| Field | Weight | Range | Meaning |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| `qualityImprovement` | 0.40 | [-1, 1] | Rubric-based quality delta |
| `overallJudgmentImprovement` | 0.30 | [-1, 1] | Holistic judge assessment delta |
| `taskCompletionImprovement` | 0.15 | {-1, 0, 1} | Did assertions pass? |
| `tokenReduction` | 0.05 | [-1, 1] | Positive = fewer tokens (more efficient) |
| `errorReduction` | 0.05 | [-1, 1] | Positive = fewer errors |
| `toolCallReduction` | 0.025 | [-1, 1] | Positive = fewer tool calls |
| `timeReduction` | 0.025 | [-1, 1] | Positive = faster |

A `tokenReduction` of -1.0 means the skilled run used ≥2× the baseline's tokens. This is common when a skill is loaded (the skill content itself consumes tokens) but is only -0.05 in the final score, so it rarely causes failure on its own.

### Run metrics

Each of `baseline`, `skilledIsolated`, and `skilledPlugin` contains a `metrics` object:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `timedOut` | Whether this run hit the timeout |
| `wallTimeMs` | Total wall-clock time |
| `taskCompleted` | Whether assertions passed |
| `tokenEstimate` | Total tokens estimated for this run. When usage events are present, computed as `inputTokens + outputTokens`; if `inputTokens` is zero but cache activity was reported, uses `cacheReadTokens + outputTokens` instead. Falls back to chars÷4 when no usage events are available. |
| `inputTokens` | Input tokens sent to the model |
| `outputTokens` | Output tokens generated by the model |
| `cacheReadTokens` | Prompt tokens served from cache |
| `cacheWriteTokens` | Prompt tokens written to cache |
| `judgeInputTokens` | Input tokens consumed by the LLM judge for this run |
| `judgeOutputTokens` | Output tokens generated by the LLM judge for this run |
| `judgeCacheReadTokens` | Judge prompt tokens served from cache |
| `judgeCacheWriteTokens` | Judge prompt tokens written to cache |
| `turnCount` | Number of agent turns |
| `toolCallCount` | Number of tool calls |
| `toolCallBreakdown` | Tool call counts by tool name |
| `errorCount` | Number of errors during the run |
| `assertionResults[]` | Per-assertion pass/fail with messages |
| `agentOutput` | The agent's final text output |

> **Tip:** To get the total input/output token cost for an eval scenario, sum the token fields across baseline and skilled runs. For example, a scenario's total input tokens are `baseline.metrics.inputTokens + skilledIsolated.metrics.inputTokens` (plus `skilledPlugin.metrics.inputTokens` if a plugin run is present). The `judge*` fields track the judging overhead separately.

> **Note:** The quality scores shown in the summary table (e.g., "4.0/5") come from `baseline.judgeResult.overallScore`, `skilledIsolated.judgeResult.overallScore`, etc. — they are on the run result object, not inside `metrics`. When parsing `results.json`, look for `judgeResult.overallScore` alongside `metrics` on each run.

### eval.yaml scenario options

Several scenario-level options in `eval.yaml` are relevant when diagnosing failures:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `timeout` | Maximum wall-clock time per run in seconds. Default is 120 seconds if omitted. Increase when skilled runs time out. |
| `reject_tools` | Array of tool names that will cause the run to fail if they are used (e.g., `["bash", "edit"]`). This is enforced as a post-run assertion in the validator (it does not sandbox or block the tool calls), and is useful to force the agent to explain rather than explore/build, leveling the playing field between baseline and skilled runs. |
| `deny_shell` | Native lane only: opt-in boolean on a stimulus (or legacy scenario). Rejects actual shell execution while preserving independent file permissions, and requires an evaluator-recorded rejection before the denial scenario can pass. Default: `false`. |
| `setup.files` | Array of files to create before the run. Gives the agent concrete code to work with, reducing variance from different scaffolding strategies. |

## Common failure patterns

### 1. Timeout with empty output

**Symptoms:**
- `timedOut: true`
- `agentOutput` is empty or just `\n\n`
- All assertions fail
- `toolCallBreakdown` shows `bash` usage

**Cause:** The model spent its entire time budget running shell commands (e.g., `dotnet new`, `dotnet add package`, exploring NuGet contents) and never produced user-facing text.

**Fixes:**
- **Increase `timeout`** in `eval.yaml` — 180s is often not enough for scenarios that involve code generation. Try 360s.
- **Restructure the prompt** to discourage bash exploration (e.g., "Show me the code" rather than "Create a project")
- **Add `reject_tools: ["bash"]`** if the scenario should be answerable without shell commands

**In CI:** a required arm that times out makes the whole eval
measurement-invalid, even when every other scenario produced clean evidence. The
evaluation workflow therefore runs `eng/vally-adapter/retry-agent-timeouts.mjs`
before the adapter. It re-runs only the timed-out scenario, using
`skill-validator evaluate --target "<agent>" --scenario "<name>"`, writes that
retry into its own `--results-dir`, and replaces only that one scenario record
in the native results file. The target filter prevents another agent with the
same scenario name from entering the retry. The agent identity is validated as
a safe single path segment before timeout lookup or retry/audit storage.
The retry result must contain exactly one verdict total, for that target, and
exactly one scenario. The original timeout must already have a pairwise
judgment with valid winner/magnitude, rubric, reasoning, and position-swap
consistency fields.
Because the retry never shares a
results directory, its sessions never merge with the first attempt's: every
role/session record stays unique and the `rejudge` pairing rules that reject
duplicate completed roles still apply unchanged. The retry judges the arms it
re-runs, so no separate `rejudge` pass is needed.

The retry is deliberately narrow. It fires only when a wall-clock timeout is the
scenario's sole defect; an `executionError`, `failedRunCount > 0`, a missing
arm, missing boolean completion evidence, a missing or malformed pairwise
judgment, objective baseline-pass/isolated-fail completion regression, or a
measured negative improvement/routing failure from non-timed-out baseline and
isolated arms is never retried. In particular, a plugin-only timeout cannot
erase a completed objective regression by replacing the whole scenario. A
negative score from a baseline- or isolated-arm timeout remains eligible because
the timeout contaminated the score. Ineligible
timeout scenarios remain listed as unresolved diagnostics
instead of disappearing from retry accounting. A second timeout,
more than two timed-out scenarios, an effective per-scenario three-arm retry
cost (including `constraints.max_duration`) that exceeds the bounded recovery
window, or any unexpected retry shape leaves the original measurement in place
and keeps the eval invalid. The systemic scenario-count guard runs before
individual budget filtering, so a widespread timeout never triggers a partial
subset of retries. Check
`agent-timeout-retry-summary.json` in the leg artifact for
`plannedScenarioCount`, `recoveredScenarioCount`, `unresolvedScenarioCount`,
`ineligibleScenarioCount`, `budgetSkippedScenarioCount`, `clearedAggregates`,
and a per-scenario reason. `plannedScenarioCount` includes every named
required-arm timeout before eligibility filtering.

After replacement, recovery recomputes execution, isolated target-agent
activation, unexpected activation, and completion-regression state from all
surviving scenarios. It clears stale `failureKind`/`skillNotActivated` values
when the evidence no longer supports them, while any true remaining failure
stays fail-closed. If stale `skill_not_activated` masked an isolated completion
regression, recomputation restores `completion_regression`. It also clears the
old `confidenceInterval`,
`isSignificant`, and `overfittingResult`; the changed sample cannot reuse the
first attempt's aggregate statistics, and native agent evals do not produce an
overfitting assessment. The adapter derives the completion and activation gates
from scenarios again instead of trusting legacy aggregate flags.

Retry runs first write outside `RESULTS_DIR`, so a workflow `SIGTERM` cannot
leave a retry `results.json` where recursive discovery can count it. Each retry
uses a unique attempt directory, so a re-entered recovery process cannot accept
an older attempt's result when the current attempt produced none. The current
attempt must contain exactly one native `results.json`; zero or multiple
aggregates remain unresolved, and colliding aggregates are retained under their
relative audit paths for diagnosis. After a
retry process finishes, its `sessions.db`, logs, and raw result (renamed
`retry-results.json`) are copied under `_agent-timeout-retry/` in the main
evaluation artifact. Workflow result counting, consolidation, summaries, and
dashboard publication also exclude this subtree as defense in depth, so exactly
one adapted per-agent `results.json` is authoritative.

`--target` and `--scenario` are repeatable, match names case-insensitively, and
exit `1` when a name matches nothing, so a typo can never quietly evaluate an
empty set and report a clean run.

### 2. Baseline already bad

**Symptoms:**
- Baseline scores are very low (1.0–2.0/5)
- Skilled scores are also low
- Quality improvement shows 0 or negative

**Cause:** The question is too hard for the model even without the skill. The skill can't fix what the model can't do.

**Fixes:**
- Simplify the scenario prompt
- Verify the baseline is working by examining `baseline.metrics.agentOutput`
- Consider whether the scenario is testing the right thing

### 3. High variance across runs

**Symptoms:**
- `perRunScores` contains both positive and negative values (e.g., `[0.07, -0.85, 0.04]`)
- A spread greater than ~0.3 between min and max scores suggests problematic variance
- Results flip between passing and failing across eval runs
- Isolated and plugin scores disagree

**Cause:** LLM non-determinism. The model takes different strategies on different runs.

**Fixes:**
- **Increase `--runs`** for more statistical stability (5 is the default; consider 7–10 for noisy scenarios)
- **Tighten the prompt** to reduce the space of valid strategies
- **Add `setup.files`** to give the model concrete files to work with rather than letting it scaffold from scratch

### 4. Quality unchanged but weighted score negative

**Symptoms:**
- Footnote says "Quality unchanged but weighted score is -X% due to: judgment, tokens, tool calls"
- The skilled output is roughly as good as baseline

**Cause:** The skill adds token overhead (the skill content itself uses tokens) but doesn't improve quality enough to offset it.

**Fixes:**
- **Improve the skill content** to produce clearly better output for this scenario
- **Reduce skill size** — shorter skills have less token overhead
- **Check if the rubric matches** what the skill actually teaches

### 5. Skill not activated

**Symptoms:**
- Skills Loaded column shows `⚠️ NOT ACTIVATED` in the legacy `skill-validator` report (the current Vally PR comment shows this as `⚠️ N/total`, e.g. `⚠️ 1/2`, when fewer scenarios activated the skill than expected)
- `skillActivationIsolated` and/or `skillActivationPlugin` fields in results.json show `activated: false` (or the legacy `skillActivation` alias)
- `detectedSkills` is empty or `skillEventCount` is 0
- The skilled run metrics look similar to baseline (the agent ran normally but without the skill's guidance)

**Cause:** The agent runtime didn't select the skill for this prompt. The skill's frontmatter `description` didn't match.

**Fixes:**
- Update the skill's `description` in SKILL.md frontmatter to better match the scenario prompt
- Make sure the description includes keywords from the scenario
- Check the scenario itself has sufficient information that the agent can reason that it needs the skill. (It should not cheat and suggest the skill.)

>   fewer model-invocable entries.

### 6. Rubric penalizes valid alternatives

**Symptoms:**
- Pairwise judge picks baseline over skill
- Both outputs are correct but use different approaches
- `pairwiseResult.rubricResults` shows the rubric criterion is too narrow

**Cause:** The rubric item favors one specific approach (e.g., step-by-step UI walkthrough) over an equally valid alternative (e.g., single CLI command).

**Fixes:**
- **Broaden the rubric** to explicitly accept multiple valid approaches
- Example: Instead of `"Shows step-by-step UI configuration"`, use `"Explains how to connect — either as a single CLI command or via the UI configuration"`

### 7. Judge regressions on close calls

**Symptoms:**
- `overallJudgmentImprovement` is -0.4 even though quality scores are similar
- Pairwise judge is inconsistent between position-swapped runs

**Cause:** When outputs are nearly equal, the judge's position bias can dominate. The position-swap mitigation defaults to "tie" on inconsistency, but the weighted scoring still penalizes.

**Fixes:**
- This is usually noise — re-run the eval to see if it persists
- If it consistently happens, improve the skill to produce clearly differentiated output

### 8. Baseline already good (no headroom)

**Symptoms:**
- Baseline scores are high (4.5–5.0/5)
- Skilled scores are similar or slightly lower
- `perRunScores` are consistently negative (e.g., `[-0.42, -0.73, -0.47]`)
- Breakdown shows negative `tokenReduction` and `toolCallReduction` (skill overhead) but no quality gain

**Cause:** The model already knows this topic well from training data. The skill can't improve on an already-excellent answer, and the overhead of loading the skill (extra tokens, tool calls) causes a net regression.

**Fixes:**
- **Add a `reject_tools` constraint** (e.g., `["bash", "edit"]`) so the eval fails if either baseline or skilled agent uses those tools — this keeps the comparison focused on answer quality instead of tool-induced overhead
- **Make the scenario harder** so the baseline struggles — add complexity, edge cases, or constraints that require the skill's specific knowledge
- **Rewrite the prompt** to be purely diagnostic (e.g., "Don't modify any files — just explain the root cause") to prevent the agent from spending time on tool calls
- **Remove the scenario** if the model consistently scores 5.0/5 without the skill — it isn't testing the skill's value

## When multiple patterns apply

Most failing scenarios match 2–3 patterns simultaneously (e.g., timeout + token overhead + high variance). Fix them in this priority order:

1. **Timeouts (#1)** — if the model can't finish, nothing else matters. Increase timeout first.
2. **Skill not activated (#5)** — if the skill never loaded, fix the description before tuning anything else.
3. **Baseline already bad (#2)** — if the baseline scores ≤2.0/5, the scenario may need simplification regardless of the skill.
4. **Baseline already good (#8)** — if the baseline scores ≥4.5/5, consider adding `reject_tools`, making the scenario harder, or removing it.
5. **High variance (#3)** — if `perRunScores` are unstable, a single eval run is unreliable. Re-run before concluding the skill is broken.
6. **Rubric/judgment issues (#6, #7)** — once the runs are stable, tune the rubric.
7. **Token overhead (#4)** — only optimize if quality is already good but the weighted score is marginally negative.

## Improving the skill vs. gaming the eval

When investigating failures, the goal is to **make the skill more useful to users** — not simply to make the eval score go up. Score improvement should be *evidence* of a better skill, not an end in itself.

### Legitimate fixes (improve the skill)

- Better skill content, structure, or examples
- Better frontmatter `description` so the skill activates on relevant prompts
- Removing a scenario where the baseline already scores perfectly (the skill genuinely adds no value)
- Adding `setup.files` so the scenario tests what was intended rather than scaffolding ability

### Illegitimate fixes (game the eval)

- Relaxing rubric criteria so both runs score higher for less
- Rewriting rubric items to match what the skill *happens* to produce rather than what a good answer *should* contain
- Softening prompt expectations to avoid exposing a real skill weakness
- Adding `reject_tools` to hide behavioral divergences between baseline and skilled runs (e.g., baseline explains while skilled run edits files — constraining tools makes the scores converge but doesn't fix the underlying issue)

### Gray area (use judgment)

- **Tightening a prompt** to reduce ambiguity is legitimate if the prompt is genuinely unclear, but illegitimate if done to steer toward the skill's strengths
- **Broadening a rubric** to accept multiple valid approaches (#6 above) is legitimate; broadening it to accept *wrong* approaches is not
- **Removing a scenario** because the baseline already aces it is an honest admission; removing it because the skill makes things worse is hiding a problem

When in doubt, ask: *"Would this change make the skill more useful to a real user, or does it just make the number go up?"*

## Analyzing results with an AI agent

The `results.json` file is designed to be machine-readable. An AI agent can:

1. **Parse the JSON** and extract metrics for each scenario
2. **Compare baseline vs skilled** metrics to identify regressions
3. **Read `agentOutput`** to see what the model actually produced
4. **Check `assertionResults`** to see which assertions failed
5. **Read `pairwiseResult.rubricResults`** for the judge's per-criterion reasoning
6. **Examine `perRunScores`** to assess variance
7. **Look at `toolCallBreakdown`** to understand what the model spent time on
8. **Cross-reference `isolatedBreakdown`** to see which metrics drove the score
9. **Review `overfittingResult`** if present — check `rubricAssessments` for items classified as `"technique"` (the rubric enforces a specific approach rather than testing an outcome). These are candidates for broadening. Also check `crossScenarioIssues` for systemic concerns about the eval design.

### Example analysis script

> **Note:** Save this as a `.py` file rather than running via `python -c "..."` — the nested quotes in f-string dictionary access are difficult to escape on the command line.

```python
import json

def analyze(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    for verdict in data['verdicts']:
        print(f"=== {verdict['skillName']} (passed={verdict['passed']}) ===")
        for scenario in verdict['scenarios']:
            name = scenario['scenarioName']
            bl_metrics = scenario['baseline']['metrics']
            sk_metrics = scenario['skilledIsolated']['metrics']
            bl_quality = scenario['baseline'].get('judgeResult', {}).get('overallScore', '?')
            sk_quality = scenario['skilledIsolated'].get('judgeResult', {}).get('overallScore', '?')
            improvement = scenario.get('improvementScore', 0)
            print(f"\n--- {name} ---")
            print(f"  Quality: baseline={bl_quality}/5, skilled={sk_quality}/5")
            print(f"  Baseline: timedOut={bl_metrics['timedOut']}, tokens={bl_metrics.get('tokenEstimate', 0)}")
            print(f"    input={bl_metrics.get('inputTokens', 0)}, output={bl_metrics.get('outputTokens', 0)}")
            print(f"  Skilled:  timedOut={sk_metrics['timedOut']}, tokens={sk_metrics.get('tokenEstimate', 0)}")
            print(f"    input={sk_metrics.get('inputTokens', 0)}, output={sk_metrics.get('outputTokens', 0)}")
            print(f"  Improvement: {improvement:.1%}")

            # perRunScores is a flat list of numbers (one per run)
            per_run = scenario.get('perRunScores', [])
            if per_run:
                formatted = ', '.join(f'{s:.2f}' for s in per_run)
                print(f"  Per-run scores: [{formatted}]")

            for a in sk_metrics.get('assertionResults', []):
                status = 'PASS' if a['passed'] else 'FAIL'
                print(f"  Assertion [{status}]: {a['message']}")

analyze('results.json')
```
